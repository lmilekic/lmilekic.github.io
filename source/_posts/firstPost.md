So I've been thinking a bit about ai therapists recently. In school I wrote one, the logic was pretty simple:

Randomly pick from:

1. Say something generic like "please continue"
2. Take whatever it was given, replace "I" with "you" and say "why do you say ____".

It's the dumbest possible thing, but is shockingly effective.

Here's a dumb sample version of it, which was made with github copilot.


<div style="text-align: center; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: 1px solid black;" >
<iframe style="height: 500px" src="/rawHtml/therapist.html" title="description"></iframe>
    <script src="/javascript/therapist.js"></script>
</div>
